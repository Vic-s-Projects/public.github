## 📈 Engineering Philosophy
I bring enterprise-level rigor and "Five Nines" reliability mindset to every project in this organization:

1.  **Security-First:** Whether it's a social app or an OS shell, security and data integrity are baked into the initial design phase.
2.  **Scalability:** Utilizing modular .NET patterns to ensure products can grow from small utilities to mass-market platforms.
3.  **Governance & Transparency:** Emphasizing clear documentation, strict version control, and clean, maintainable codebases.
